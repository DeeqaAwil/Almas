<p1> I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
</p1> <br><br/>
<p2>
  HTML is cool <br/>
  CSS is cooler <br/>
  JS is the best <br/>
  </p2>
  <h3> What do you need to create a website?</h3>
  <p3>
    Not much!
    A computer (always a good start)
    A text editor (I am using atom)
    A web browser (I am using chrome)
    Some HTML, CSS and JS files
    </p3> <br><br/>

    <p4> Follow my progress on github! </p4>
